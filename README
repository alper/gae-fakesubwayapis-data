These are the raw data files used by Fake Subway APIs:

      http://fakesubwayapis.appspot.com
      http://github.com/straup/gae-fakesubwayapis

They are not 100% compliant with the Google Transit Feed Specification but are
modeled after the agency, stops and routes definitions with "fsa_" extensions
where necessary.

They are also incomplete, as of this writing.
